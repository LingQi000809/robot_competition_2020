# Milestone 1
## Get the robot to move

# Agenda
- [x] Get familiar with the kit and ZumoShield
- [x] Code 
- [x] Complete the first milestone

I read the documentation and watched the turorial on Moodle, and then wrote the code.
1. Install the ZumoShield Library.
2. Set speeds for the motors.
3. Make a stop point based on the time passed.

Then I set up an arena for Milestone1.
