
# Milestone 5
## Solve a single maze with branching.

### Arena Setup

### Strategy / Logic
#### 1. Types of Intersections
- Left Turn  
![left intersection](left intersection.jpeg)
When the line is under the leftmost sensors of the robot, the robot is considered to encounter a left turn.  

- Right Turn  
![right intersection](right intersection.jpeg)
When the line is under the rightmost sensors of the robot, the robot is considered to encounter a right turn.  

- T Intersection  
![t intersection](t intersection.jpeg)
When the line is under every sensor of the robot, the robot is considered to encounter a T intersection.
**The end of the maze is also considered a T intersection.**

- Dead End  
![deadend](deadend.jpeg)
When the line ends without any intersection, the robot is considered to encounter a dead end.

#### 2. Actions

### Problems Encountered

#### 1. super slow turns in the dead-end

#### 2. half-turn vs. full-turn

#### 3. detecting T intersection


  
### MILESTONE 5 COMPLETED!
